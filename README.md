Peer Assessment Project for the Coursera Getting &amp; Cleaning Data course


This repo consists of a single script, run_analysis.R. This script reads in data from the UCI HAR Dataset (found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), and outputs a new data set of averages of the means and standards deviations of each of the variables contained in the dataset, per subject per activity.

Of note, this script relies on the "reshape2" package.
